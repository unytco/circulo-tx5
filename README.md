### A Playful Take on p2p Payments

<div align="left">
<h3>

</h3>
<h3> 
Introduction
</h3>
<p>
Circulo is a generosity oriented peer-to-peer payments system, built using the Unyt mutual credit accounting engine. 
</p>
<p>
Everyone starts with an account balance of zero and a small credit limit. Your credit limit determines the max you can spend below zero. 
</p>
<p>
Circulo makes use of a very simple credit algorithm: every time you send someone some units, your credit limit increases by 10.  This is a very simple, and easily gameable credit algorithm. It also makes it easy for people to play with it.
</p>
<p>
In Circulo, as soon as you send someone units, your account will be debited.  However, the receiver's account balance won't include those units until they exercize their own agency and choose to accept them. If they never accept them, they remain available for them to collect. No one else is able to claim them.
</p>
<p>
By anchoring activity in the agency of the participants themselves, Circulo opens up some interesting new efficiencies and possibilities. These will get explored in more detail in future releases.
</p>
<h3>
Testing
</h3> 
<p>
This second version of Circulo has a few changes under the hood, most notably that most people will be running a lightweight version of the app that we call zero-arc.
</p>
<p>
The main thing we want to put stress on during this test is the current configuration's ability to handle lots of people and lots of transactions. So, go ahead and make a bunch of sends and requests to lots of folks.
</p>
We are planning to do a couple of focused rounds of testing of this version of Circulo. 
</p>
<p>
Testing will launch on Tuesday, October 14th and we are asking folks to really kick the tires on the app for a couple of days. 
</p>
<p>
After Thursday, the 16th, people can still play with the app, but assume that most people won't be online.
</p>
<p>
We are planning to do a second round of testing of the app early next week.
<p>
</p>
<p>
Find some people to send CIRC to in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WCAUZX50uofbkgWRT02s2iV9bHYi3IYEl40bT8dBrHk/edit?usp=sharing">Circulo2 Addresses Sheet</a>.
And <a href="https://forms.gle/eFLtpB7Ak5ADt1aE8">add yourself using this form</a> so that others can send CIRC to you. 
</p>
<p>
If you see an error, please <a href="https://github.com/unytco/circulo-tx5/issues">report it as an issue</a> in this repo (if not already reported). 
</p>
<p>
To get past an error:

1. Reload: When in doubt try: Right click > Reload
2. Restart: When a few reload tries don't work, please quit and restart
3. Wait: making yourself a cup of tea resolves most things

</p>
<p>
We are using software called Sentry to help track errors so we can better understand their frequency and context. But you reporting issues is , too.
